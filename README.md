# Bellabeat-Wellness-Technology
Capstone project from Google Data Analytics Certification. Analyze data from fitness trackers and apply findings to Bellabeat products and marketing strategy.

For this project, I cleaned and analyzed the data using Microsoft SQL Server. I created visualizations using Tableau, and then prepared the final presentation using MS PowerPoint.

# Bellabeat-Wellness-Technology
Capstone project from Google Data Analytics Certification. Analyze data from fitness trackers and apply findings to Bellabeat products and marketing strategy. For this project, data was cleaned and analyzed using Microsoft SQL Server. I created visualizations using Tableau, and then prepared the final presentation using MS PowerPoint.
